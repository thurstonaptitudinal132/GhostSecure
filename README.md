# GhostSecure 2.1

**Active Directory Attack Detector for Windows**  
Runs as a background Windows service and alerts your team the moment it detects a live AD attack — Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, DCSync, Golden Ticket, and more.

## What It Does

GhostSecure monitors your Windows Security Event Log in real time and fires an alert the moment it spots a known Active Directory attack pattern. It runs silently as a Windows service — no window, no interaction needed. When it detects something, a popup appears on the admin's screen immediately.

---

## Attacks Detected

| Attack | Event IDs Monitored | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Kerberoasting** | 4769 | Unusual Kerberos service ticket requests — attacker harvesting crackable tickets offline |
| **Pass-the-Hash** | 4624 | NTLM logon without a matching prior interactive session — stolen hash being used |
| **DCSync (Mimikatz)** | 4662 | Replication privileges invoked by a non-DC account — attacker dumping all password hashes |
| **Golden Ticket** | 4768, 4769 | TGT issued with abnormal lifetime or encryption — forged Kerberos ticket in use |
| **LDAP Recon / BloodHound** | 1644 | Burst of LDAP queries — network mapping tool scanning for attack paths |
| **AS-REP Roasting** | 4768 | Pre-auth not required on an account — attacker grabbing crackable AS-REP hashes |
| **Skeleton Key** | 4673 | Sensitive privilege use on DC — malware implant allowing master-password login |
| **Audit Log Cleared** | 1102 | Security log wiped — attacker covering their tracks |

## Features

- Runs as a **Windows Service** — starts automatically, survives reboots
- **Real-time detection** — monitors Security Event Log continuously
- **Desktop popup alerts** via `msg.exe` to the admin workstation
- **Email alerts** (optional SMTP — password stored in environment variable, never hardcoded)
- **Alert deduplication** — same attack only fires once every 5 minutes, not 100 times
- **Status dashboard** — `python main.py --gui` shows live detection stats
- **Configurable exclusions** — whitelist accounts for false positive suppression
- **Structured logging** to `C:\SecurityLogs\ad_attack_log.txt`

---

## Requirements

- Windows Server 2016+ or Windows 10/11 (domain-joined)
- Python 3.10+
- Domain Administrator rights for installation
- Windows Advanced Audit Policy logging enabled (see below)
- `pywin32` for Windows service support

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install pywin32 ldap3
```

1. Copy this folder to the Domain Controller or a domain-joined machine
2. Open `config.py` and configure:
   - `ADMIN_HOSTNAME` — computer name where alert popups should appear
   - `KNOWN_DOMAIN_CONTROLLERS` — your DC hostnames e.g. `["DC01", "DC02"]`
   - `DOMAIN_NAME` — your domain e.g. `"REDPARROT"`
3. Right-click `Install.bat` → **Run as administrator**
4. Done — service starts automatically

**Verify it's running:**
```cmd
sc query GhostSecure2ADDetector
```
Should show `STATE: RUNNING`.

---

## Enabling Windows Audit Logging (Required)

GhostSecure needs Windows to record security events. Without this it has nothing to monitor.

1. Open **Group Policy Management** on the Domain Controller
2. Edit **Default Domain Controllers Policy**
3. Navigate to: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies`
4. Enable **Success and Failure** for:
   - Account Logon → Audit Kerberos Authentication Service
   - Account Logon → Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations
   - DS Access → Audit Directory Service Access
   - Logon/Logoff → Audit Logon
   - Privilege Use → Audit Sensitive Privilege Use
   - System → Audit Security State Change
5. Run: `gpupdate /force`

---

## Email Alerts (Optional)

1. Set `ENABLE_EMAIL_ALERTS = True` in `config.py`
2. Fill in your SMTP server details
3. Store your password as a system environment variable — **never hardcode it**:

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
  'GHOSTSECURE_SMTP_PASSWORD', 'YourPasswordHere', 'Machine')
```

Restart the service after setting the variable.

---

## Dashboard

```cmd
python main.py --gui
```

Shows live detection counts, service status, and recent alerts.

---

## Running Tests

GhostSecure ships with 53 unit tests covering all 7 detectors, alert manager, time helpers, and AD helpers.

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest tests/ -v
```

Stops and removes the service. Log files at `C:\SecurityLogs\` are preserved.

## Changelog

**v2.1.1** *(current)*
- Fixed: Pervasive curly/smart quotes used as string delimiters — caused `SyntaxError` on Python 3.10+
- Fixed: `starttls()` called without SSL context — no certificate verification, MITM-able — now uses `ssl.create_default_context()`
- Fixed: Self-test checked for `GhostSecure 2.0` but `config.py` was `2.1` — test always failed
- Fixed: 14 files had module headers saying `2.0` while `config.py` was `2.1` — all updated
- Fixed: `EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX` hardcoded `2.0` in `config.py` — updated to `2.1`
- Fixed: `build.bat`, `Install.bat`, `Uninstall.bat` all referenced `2.0` — updated
- Fixed: 3 silent `except Exception: pass` blocks in `status_dashboard.py` — now log to `logger.debug`
- Fixed: Encoding mojibake in all user-facing alert strings — replaced with clean `-`
- Added: `tests/test_detectors.py` — 29 tests across all 7 detectors
- Added: `tests/test_alert_manager.py` — 6 tests: init, format, cooldown, count
- Added: `tests/test_time_helpers.py` — 12 tests
- Added: `tests/test_ad_helpers.py` — 6 tests
- Added: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Python 3.10/3.11/3.12, syntax check, pytest with coverage, flake8
- 53 unit tests total, all passing

**v2.1**
- Fixed: SMTP password now read from `GHOSTSECURE_SMTP_PASSWORD` env var — never hardcoded
- Fixed: `alerts_triggered` counter was always 0 — now correctly tracked and shown in dashboard
- Fixed: Golden Ticket `_tgt_issuance` dict was not thread-safe — added `threading.Lock()`
- Fixed: Pass-the-Hash logon tracking was not thread-safe — added `threading.Lock()`
- Fixed: LDAP Windows auth now uses SASL/GSSAPI instead of broken NTLM empty-password bind
- Fixed: GUI dashboard showed frozen stats — DetectorEngine now runs in background thread
- Fixed: Pass-the-Hash false positives in office hours — window extended to 8 hours (28800s)
- Fixed: Event reader re-processed same events on each cycle — `EventRecordID` now tracked
- Fixed: Audit log clear had no account exclusions — `AUDIT_LOG_CLEAR_EXCLUDED_ACCOUNTS` added
- Fixed: LDAP bind password also moved to `GHOSTSECURE_LDAP_PASSWORD` env var

**v2.0**
- Initial release — 8 AD attack detectors, Windows service architecture

## Disclaimer

GhostSecure is an **early warning system**, not a complete security solution. It detects known attack patterns from Windows event logs — it does not block attacks or replace a full EDR/SIEM. Always investigate and respond when an alert fires.

Under GDPR/ICO guidelines, security logs should be retained for at least 12 months.
